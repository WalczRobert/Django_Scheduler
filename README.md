# Django_Scheduler
Team time-off scheduler

User selects Name, reason, and dates to be off work. If the date is not already reserved equal to MaxOut then request is granted. If date is equal to or greater than Max Out setting (int) the request is denied.

To do:
1.	add denied requests to a override queue for admin to override if they chose
2.	Email user and admin an Outlook Meeting invite for days off
3.	add a month calendar showing reserved days and totals for each day. Give user a visual of reserved days.

Developers are welcome to improve upon this project.
